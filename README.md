Practice challenges for Facebook interviews

Facebook has a really thorough interview process including practice
challenges for the live coding interview. I wrote a solution to one of
the challenges which I suspect is a memory hog and fails. Since I'm
going to rewrite it I want to save my original attempt. Hence, I created
this repo to save my solutions.
